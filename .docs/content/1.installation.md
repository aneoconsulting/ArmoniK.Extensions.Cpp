## Prerequisites

- CMake minimum version 3.22
- gRPC minimum version 1.50 (installed or built)
- [ArmoniK API](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK.Api) latest installed 

## How to build for Linux

### Prerequisites Linux

1. Install Docker on your Linux system. Follow the instructions on the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
2. Clone the repository containing the source code and the necessary scripts.

### CLion setup

- In WSL:
  - run ```restart-build-env.sh```
  - Specify the ARMONIK_API_DIR as an environment variable prior to running this script if the ArmoniK.Api cpp installation directory is not ```../ArmoniK.Api/packages/cpp/install```
- In your IDE:
  - Setup ``Remote Host`` as your toolchain and specify the user as ``root``, password as ``password`` and the address and ports to match the REMOTE_BUILD_ADDRESS variable specified in the script

### Visual Studio setup

- In WSL, run ```setup-remote.sh```
  - You will be connected to the docker in interactive mode. Then, you can build and run your project in the Linux environment.
  - If You want to perform remote development in your IDE, then run:
  - ```service ssh start```
- In your IDE:
  - Setup ``Remote Host`` by specifying the user as ``root``, password as ``password`` and the ports to 2223 as in the script.
  - As the project source is mounted in the docker, you may want to disable the file copies for ``rsync``.

## How to build for Windows (Client only)

### Prerequisites Windows

- CMake
- gRPC
- ArmoniK API installed

### Visual Studio

The Windows build is only for the client side, not the worker. When the prerequisites are satisfied, set up your IDE and configure it with CMake.
